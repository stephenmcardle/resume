\section{\bf\large Summary}
Adaptable, motivated, and responsible recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from a renowned technical university. Experience in web development, data science, research, and algorithm design, with advanced skillsets in JavaScript and NodeJS, Python, and database management systems, both SQL and NoSQL. Looking to begin a full-time development position.

\section{\bf\large Technical Experience}

{\sl Full-Stack Developer} \hfill October 2017 - Present \\
Turbo 360 \hfill New York, NY \\
Working with the MERN stack and producing reusable serverless functions to expand the Turbo 360 platform, such as a Text Metrics function that parses a given text and returns sentiment data, commons words, and processed versions of the text. Also helping new and experienced users become accustomed to programming in the Turbo environment by developing tutorials and workshops.

{\sl Full-Stack Developer} \hfill September 2017 - May 2018 \\
Senior Design Marketplace \hfill Hoboken, NJ \\
Created a new system to revolutionize Senior Design courses at Stevens Institute of Technology. The system expedites and simplifies the entire Senior Design process, as well as promotes cross-discipline projects. The team used Scrum along with Node, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Mustache/Hogan Templating.

{\sl Lead Programmer} \hfill September 2017 - October 2017 \\
Co-Authorship Network \hfill Hoboken, NJ \\
Compiled data from Scopus, a bibliographic database, and compared it to a database of Stevens faculty members to create a network of co-authorships amongst professors at Stevens. Developed network graphs using Python and Gephi in order to study co-authorships by gender and department.

{\sl Research Assistant} \hfill May 2017 - August 2017\\
Epidemic Disease Simulator \hfill Hoboken, NJ \\
Programmed a simulator designed to track the spread of epidemic diseases using NodeJS. The project was based on a simulator written in C++ and released by the University of Pittsburgh. Efficiently leveraging the simulator required many optimizations of JavaScript code and classes, which resulted in up to an 80\% decrease in run-time.
